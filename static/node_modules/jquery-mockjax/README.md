## About Mockjax and Its History ##

Most backend developers are familiar with the concepts of [mocking
objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) or stubbing in
methods for unit testing. For those not familiar with mocking, it's the
simulation of an interface or API for testing or integration development
purposes. Mocking with front-end development though is still quite new. Mockjax
gives front end developers the ability to define ajax requests that should be 
mocked out, as well as how those requests should be responded to. These mocks
can be extremely simple or quite complex, representing the entire request-response
workflow.

At appendTo we developed a lot of applications which use
[RESTFUL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer)
web services, but much of the time those services are not yet created. 
We spec out the service contract and data format at the beginning of a project 
and develop the front-end interface against mock data while the back end team 
builds the production services.

This plugin was originally developed by appendTo in March 2010 and the 
[team](http://twitter.com/appendto/team) has been using it in many projects since.


## Basic Documentation ##

### API Methods ###

Mockjax consists of just a few methods, each listed below. You'll find plenty of 
examples in the sections below, but if you're looking for a specific option,
checkout this list:

* `Number $.mockjax(/* Object */ options)`
  * Sets up a mockjax handler for a matching request
  * Returns that handler's index, can be used to clear individual handlers
  * `options`: [Object] Defines the settings to use for the mocked request
      * `url`: [String | RegExp] Specifies the url of the request that the data should be mocked for. If it is a string and contains any asterisks ( `*` ), they will be treated as a wildcard by translating to a regular expression. Any `*` will be replaced with `.+`. If you run into trouble with this shortcut, switch to using a full regular expression instead of a string and asterisk combination
      * `data`: [Object] In addition to the URL, match parameters
      * `type`: [String] Specify what HTTP method to match, usually GET or POST. Case-insensitive, so `get` and `post` also work
      * `headers`: [Object] Keys will be simulated as additional headers returned from the server for the request (**NOTE: This is NOT used to match request headers!**)
      * `status`: [Number] An integer that specifies a valid server response code. This simulates a server response code
      * `statusText`: [String] Specifies a valid server response code description. This simulates a server response code description
      * `responseTime`: [Number] An integer that specifies a simulated network and server latency (in milliseconds)
      * `isTimeout`: [Boolean] Determines whether or not the mock will force a timeout on the request
      * `contentType`: [String] Specifies the content type for the response
      * `response`: [Function] A function that accepts the request settings and allows for the dynamic setting of response settings (including the body of the response) upon each request (see examples below)
      * `responseText`: [String] Specifies the mocked text, or a mocked object literal, for the request
      * `responseXML`: [String] Specifies the mocked XML for the request
      * `proxy`: [String] Specifies a path to a file, from which the contents will be returned for the request
      * `lastModified`: [String] A date string specifying the mocked last-modified time for the request. This is used by `$.ajax` to determine if the requested data is new since the last request
      * `etag`: [String] Specifies a unique identifier referencing a specific version of the requested data. This is used by `$.ajax` to determine if the requested data is new since the last request. (see [HTTP_ETag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag))
      * `onAfterSuccess`: [Function] A callback that will be called after the success method has been called, this is useful to check a condition after the call has been completed
      * `onAfterError`: [Function] A callback that will be called after the error method has been called, this is useful to check a condition after the call has been completed
      * `onAfterComplete`: [Function] Similar to onAfterSuccess, but will be executed after the complete method has been called
* `Object $.mockjax.handler(/* Number */ id)`
  * Returns the mock request settings for the handler with the provided `id`
* `void $.mockjax.clear([/* Number */ id])`
  * If the `id` is provided, the handler with that ID is cleared (that is, requests matching it will no longer do so, the hnadler is completely removed)
  * If no `id` is provided, all handlers are cleared, resetting Mockjax to its initial state
* `Array<Object> $.mockjax.mockedAjaxCalls()`
  * Returns an array of all mocked ajax calls with each entry being the request settings object as passed into the `$.mockjax()` function
* `Array<Object> $.mockjax.unfiredHandlers()`
  * Returns an array of all mock handler settings that have not been used. In other words, if a handler has been used for a `$.ajax()` call then it will _not_ appear in this array
* `Array<Object> $.mockjax.unmockedAjaxCalls()`
  * Returns an array of all unmocked Ajax calls that were made. The array contains the settings object passed into `$.ajax({...})`

### Overview: Your First Mock ###

Our first example will be for a simple REST service for a fortune app
with the REST endpoint being `/restful/fortune` which returns the
following JSON message:

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "fortune" : "Are you a turtle?"
}
```

To pull the fortune into our page, we'd use the following HTML and jQuery
code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Fortune App</title>
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>
  </head>
<body>
  <div id="fortune"></div>
</body>
</html>
```
```javascript
$.getJSON("/restful/fortune", function(response) {
  if ( response.status == "success") {
    $("#fortune").html( "Your fortune is: " + response.fortune );
  } else {
    $("#fortune").html( "Things do not look good, no fortune was told" );
  }
});
```

At this point if we were to run this code it would fail since the REST
service has yet to be implemented. This is where the benefit of the
Mockjax plugin starts to pay off. The first step in using Mockjax is to
include the plugin by just adding a regular script tag:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="vendor/jquery.mockjax.js"></script>
</head>
```

Once you have that included, you can start intercepting Ajax requests
and mocking the responses. So let's mock out the service by including
the following code:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/restful/fortune",
  responseText: {
    status: "success",
    fortune: "Are you a mock turtle?"
  }
});
```

**Defining a JSON string inline requires a `JSON.stringify()` method to be
available. For some browsers you may need to include
[json2.js](https://raw.github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/master/json2.js), 
which is included in the `lib` folder.** However, you could also simply 
provide an already stringified version of your JSON in the `responseText`
property.

_If you plan on mocking xml responses, you may also have to include
`jquery.xmldom.js`, which can also be found in the `lib` folder._

### Mockjax in Depth ###

What Mockjax does at this point is replace the `$.ajax()` method with a
wrapper that transparently checks the URL being requested. If the URL
matches one defined by `$.mockjax()`, it intercepts the request
and sets up a mock `XMLHttpRequest` object before executing the
`jQuery.ajax()` handler. Otherwise, the request is handed back to the
native `$.ajax()` method for normal execution. One benefit in this
implementation detail is that by simulating the `XMLHttpRequest` object, 
the plugin continues to make use of jQuery's native ajax handling, so 
there are no concerns with implementing a custom Ajax workflow.

As you write code to mock responses, there's great value in the fact that 
there are no modifications required to production code. The mocks can be
transparently inserted. This provides easy integration into most
frameworks by including the plugin and mock definitions through your
build framework. It's also possible to include it at run time by
listening for a query string flag and injecting the plugin and definitions.

Now let's look at the various approaches to defining mocks as offered by
the plugin. The sections below feature an extensive overview of the
flexibility in Mockjax and creating responses.

#### Data Types Available for Mocking ####

jQuery is able to handle and parse `Text`, `HTML`, `JSON`, `JSONP`,
`Script` and `XML` data formats and Mockjax is able to mock any of those
formats. Two things to note: depending upon how you mock out `JSON` and
`JSONP` you may need to include [json2.js](https://raw.github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/master/json2.js) 
for the `JSON.stringify()` method (older browsers only, typically). Additionally 
if you mock XML inline, you'll need to include the [`xmlDOM`](http://github.com/jakerella/jquery-xmldom) 
plugin that transforms a string of XML into a DOM object. However, if you use 
the proxy approach outlined below then there should be no need to include either 
the JSON or XMLDOM plugins in any case.


## Detailed Request and Response Definition ##

### Defining a Request to Match ###

The first thing you need to do when mocking a request is define the URL
end-point to intercept and mock. As with our example above this can be a
simple string:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/url/to/rest-service"
});
```

or contain a `*` as a wildcard:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  // Matches /data/quote, /data/tweet etc.
  url: "/data/*"
});
```

or a full regular expression:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  // Matches /data/quote, /data/tweet but not /data/quotes
  url: /^\/data\/(quote|tweet)$/i
});
```

You can also match against the data option in addition to url:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
    url:  "/rest",
    data: { action: "foo" }
});
```

To capture URL parameters, use a capturing regular expression for the 
URL and a `urlParams` array to indicate, ordinally, the names of the 
paramters that will be captured:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  // matches /author/{any number here}/isbn/{any number with dashes here}
  // for example: "/author/1234/isbn/1234-5678-9012-0"
  url: /^\/author\/([\d]+)\/isbn\/([\d\-]+)$/,
  // names of matching params
  urlParams: ["authorID", "isbnNumber"],
  response: function (settings) {
    var authorID = settings.urlParams.authorID;
    var isbnNumber = settings.urlParams.isbnNumber;
    // etc...
  }
});
```

### Define a Response ###

The second step is to define the type and content of the response. The two main
properties you will be dealing with are either `responseText` or
`responseXML`. These properties mirror the native `XMLHttpRequest`
object properties that are set during a live response. There are three
different patterns for specifying the responses: Inline, Proxy, and
Callback.

#### Inline Responses ####

A simple text response would be:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/restful/api",
  responseText: "A text response from the server"
});
```

A simple JSON response would be:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/restful/api",
  // You may need to include the [json2.js](https://raw.github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/master/json2.js) library for older browsers
  responseText: { "foo": "bar" }
});
```

Also note that a JSON response is really just a text response that jQuery will 
parse as JSON for you (and return a JSOn object to the `success` and `complete` 
callbacks).

A simple XML response would be:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/restful/api",
  // Need to include the xmlDOM plugin to have this translated into a DOM object
  responseXML: "<document><quote>Hello world!</quote></document>"
});
```

As you can see, if you have a significant amount of data being
mocked this becomes unwieldy. So that brings us to the next pattern:
the proxy.

#### Proxy ####

In this example below, the Mockjax plugin will intercept requests for
`/restful/api` and redirect them to `/mocks/data.json`:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/restful/api",
  proxy: "/mocks/data.json"
});
```

The `/mocks/data.json` file can have any valid JSON content you want, and allows 
you to maintain that mock data in its own file for maintainability.

#### Callback ####

In the final response pattern, we can define a callback function on the
`response` property and have it set `responseText` or `responseXML` as
needed:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/restful/api",
  response: function(settings) {
    // Investigate the `settings` to determine the response...

    this.responseText = "Hello world!";
  }
});
```

The default version of this callback is synchronous. If you provide both parameters
to the callback function, you can use asynchronous code to set the dynamic response.

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: '/restful/api',
  response: function(settings, done) {
    var self = this;
    someAsyncMethod(function(data){
      self.responseText = data;
      done();
    });
  }
});
```

Note that the callback is given the settings provided to the `$.mockjax({...})`
method merged with any Ajax settings defined by jQuery or your application. This 
allows you to thoroughly investigate the request before setting the response 
body (or headers).


## Advanced Mocking Techniques ##

At this point we've looked at a series of basic mocking techniques with
Mockjax and will now unpack some of the additional functionality
contained in the plugin.

### Simulating Response Time and Latency ###

Simulating network and server latency for a mock is as simple as adding
a `responseTime` property to your mock definition:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/restful/api",
  // Simulate a network latency of 750ms
  responseTime: 750,
  responseText: "A text response from the server"
});
```

### Simulating HTTP Response Statuses ###

It's also possible to simulate response statuses other than 200 (default
for Mockjax) by simply adding a `status` property.

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/restful/api",
  // Server 500 error occurred
  status: 500,
  responseText: "A text response from the server"
});
```

These forced error status codes will be handled just as if the server had 
returned the error: the `error` callback will get executed with the proper 
arguments.

### Setting the Content-Type ###

You can set the content type to associate with the mock response, in the
example below, we're setting a JSON content type.

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/restful/api",
  contentType: "application/json",
  responseText: {
    hello: "World!"
  }
});
```

### Setting Additional HTTP Response Headers ###

Additional HTTP Response Headers may be provided by setting a key in the
headers object literal:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/restful/api",
  contentType: "application/json",
  responseText: {
    hello: "World!"
  },
  headers: {
    etag: "xyz123"
  }
});
```

### Dynamically Generating Mock Definitions ###

In some situations, all of your REST calls are based upon a URL schema.
Mockjax has the ability for you to specify a callback function that is
handed the `$.ajax` request settings. The callback function may then
either return false to allow the request to be handled natively, or
return an object literal with relevant Mockjax parameters set. Below is
an example that rewrites all Ajax requests to proxy to static mocks:

```javascript
$.mockjax(function(settings) {
  
  // settings.url might be: "/restful/<service>" such as "/restful/user"
  
  var service = settings.url.match(/\/restful\/(.*)$/);
  if ( service ) {
    return {
      proxy: "/mocks/" + service[1] + ".json"
    };
  }
  // If you get here, there was no url match
  return;
});
```

### Accessing Request Headers ###

In some situations, you may need access to the  request headers to determine
matching or response bodies. To do this, you will need to specify a 
callback function that is handed the `$.ajax` request settings:

```javascript
$.mockjax(function( requestSettings ) {
  // Here is our manual URL matching...
  if ( requestSettings.url === "/restful/user" ) {
    // We have a match, so we return a response callback...
    return {
      response: function( origSettings ) {
      	
      	// now we check the request headers, which may be set directly 
      	// on the xhr object through an ajaxSetup() call or otherwise:
      	
      	if ( requestSettings.headers["Authentication"] === "some-token" ) {
      	  this.responseText = { user: { id: 13 } };
      	} else {
  		  this.status = 403;
  		  this.responseText = "You are not authorized";
        }
      }
    };
  }
  // If you get here, there was no url match
  return;
});
```

### Forced Simulation of Server Timeouts ###

Because of the way Mockjax was implemented, it takes advantage of
jQuery's internal timeout handling for requests. But if you'd like to
force a timeout for a request you can do so by setting the `isTimeout`
property to true:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: '/restful/api',
  responseTime: 1000,
  isTimeout: true
});
```

### Dynamically Generating Mock Responses ###

It's also possible to dynamically generate the response text upon each
request by implementing a callback function on the `response` parameter:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/restful/webservice",
  dataType: "json",
  response: function(settings) {
    this.responseText = {
      randomText: "random " + Math.random()
    };
  }
});
```

### Data Types ###

Many of the examples above mock a `json` response. You can also mock `xml`:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/some/xml",
  dataType: "xml",
  responseXML: "<document><say>Hello world XML</say></document>"
});
```

(Don't forget that it's likely you'll need the [`xmlDOM`](http://github.com/jakerella/jquery-xmldom) library as well!)

And `html`:

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/some/webservice",
  dataType: "html",
  responseText: "<div>Hello there</div>"
});
```

### Performing Actions After Request Completion ###

If you need to perform some actions after a call has completed you can 
use one of the `onAfter{Xxxxx}` options. For example, to fire a method when 
a request completes (either successfully or not):

```javascript
$.mockjax({
  url: "/api/end/point",
  onAfterComplete: function() {
    // do any required cleanup
  }
});
```

### Globally Defining Mockjax Settings ###

It is also possible to define the global defaults for all Mockjax
requests by overwriting the `$.mockjaxSettings` object. By default the
settings are as follows:

```javascript
{
  logging:       true,
  status:        200,
  statusText:    "OK",
  responseTime:  500,
  isTimeout:     false,
  throwUnmocked: false,
  contentType:   "text/plain",
  response:      "",
  responseText:  "",
  responseXML:   "",
  proxy:         "",
  proxyType:     "GET",
  lastModified:  null,
  etag:          "",
  headers: {
    etag: "IJF@H#@923uf8023hFO@I#H#",
    "content-type" : "text/plain"
  }
}
```

To overwrite a particular settings such as the default `content-type`, you
would do the following:

```javascript
$.mockjaxSettings.contentType = "application/json";
```

### Removing Mockjax Handlers ###

If you need to reset the Mockjax handlers you've added, just call 
`$.mockjax.clear()`. _This will NOT reset the `$.mockjaxSettings`!_

```javascript
$.mockjax.clear();
```

You can also clear individual mock handlers using their ID:

```javascript
var id = $.mockjax({
   ...
});

$.mockjax.clear(id);
```


## Miscellaneous Information ##

### jQuery Version Support ###

We strive to ensure that Mockjax is tested on the furthest patch version of all 
minor (and major) versions of jQuery beginning with 1.3.2 going all the way 
through 2.x. In other words, we don't test 1.6.1, but rather 1.6.4 (the furthest
patch version on the 1.6.x line). The QUnit tests in the `/test` directory include 
links to each version of jQuery tested in the header.

### Browsers Tested ###

Note that jQuery Mockjax generally supports whatever browser jQuery supports. 
However, it is important to understand that various versions of jQuery have dropped 
support for different versions of browsers over the years. The point is, be sure 
to test on the browser versions you support!

We use virtual machines to test current versions of the browsers below. In addition, 
we test the minimum version specified next to the browser (with the exception of 
IE which specifies the versions we test).

* Internet Explorer (7-11)
* Firefox (3.6)
* Safari (5.1)
* Chrome (stable only, significantly older versions are not available)
* Opera (9.6; although 9.x does not work with jQuery 1.9+)

_Please note that while we strive to keep `master` as bug free as possible, we do 
not necessarily run tests in all of the above browsers for every single commit. We  
do, however, ensure all tests are passing before tagging a release._

### Release History ###

Please read the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/jakerella/jquery-mockjax/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
for a list of changes per release.

Note that all releases are tagged in Github for easy reference, the `master` branch 
should *not* be considered a stable release!
